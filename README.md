# studious-waddle

This repository is dedicated to improve my programming skills - starting with basic loops, list manipulation, to advanced sorting algorithms and software construction methods such as iterator pattern and factory pattern.

This repository will only hold C++ code, and is only a portion of what I have learned throughout my college career. I will make other repos for other programming languages and skills (machine learning algorithms, scripts to automate tasks, side projects). 

My future learning goals include: 

SQL
HTML/CSS
Javascript 
... more later
