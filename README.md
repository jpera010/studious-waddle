# studious-waddle

This repository is dedicated to honing my programming skills - starting with basic loops, list manipulation, to sorting algorithms and software construction methods such as iterator pattern and factory pattern.

This repository will only hold C++ code, I will make other repos for other programming languages and skills. 

My future learning goals include: 

SQL
HTML/CSS
Javascript 
... more later
